**LAB 4:** 

**USING ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY AND MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS**

**CHALLENGE:** Oakridge County's Department of Community Services is facing critical decisions about how to allocate limited resources, place service facilities, and ensure equitable program access across its diverse population of urban, suburban, and rural communities.

The county has recently received a federal grant to improve community services but faces three (3) interconnected challenges:

1. **Resource Allocation**: How to distribute $10 million in community development funds across 25 neighborhoods with varying needs, populations, and accessibility challenges.  
2. **Service Center Placement**: Where to locate 5 new multi-purpose community centers offering job training, health screenings, and social services.  
3. **Program Access**: How to ensure fair access to limited-enrollment educational programs for residents from different demographic backgrounds.

As the data science team supporting the county's community planning department, you've been asked to develop an algorithm to address each of these challenges while balancing efficiency, equity, and transparency.

**YOUR TASK:** Implement and analyze three specialized algorithms that address each of the county’s challenges. 

**Algorithm 1: Optimal Resource Allocation**

Determine how to distribute community development funds across neighborhoods based on:

\-Population size

\-Economic need indicators

\-Geographic accessibility

\-Existing resource levels

**Algorithm 2: Service Center Location Optimization**

Identify the optimal locations for new community centers based on:

\-Geographic distribution of population

\-Population density

\-Distance between residents and potential service locations

\-Transportation accessibility

**Algorithm 3: Equity-Adjusted Program Access**

Develop a fair system for program enrollment that:

\-Accounts for merit-based factors

\-Addresses historical disparities

\-Ensures diverse representation

\-Maintains system integrity

**DATASETS**

You will work with three different synthetic datasets that represent Oakridge County’s communities. 

1. Neighborhood data: Population, need scores, and location information for all 25 neighborhoods.  
2. Population distribution: Geographic coordinates and population density across the county.  
3. Program applicant data: Application scores and demographic information for program candidates.

**REFLECTION QUESTIONS**

1. Summarize the key findings from your analysis. What do the results suggest about how the county should allocate the resources?  
     
2. Optimizing Resource Allocations:  
   1. Which areas have the highest population density? The lowest?  
   2. Which center serves the most people? The fewest? Why might this matter in policy decisions?  
        
3. Accessibility of Service Centers:  
   1. Which population points are furthest from their assigned centers? What challenges might this create?  
   2. Are there any population areas that appear underserved by this distribution?  
        
4. Modifying the Algorithm:  
   1. How would the results change if you weighted certain conditions differently? Try it and see.   
   2. What happens if we reduce the number of centers from 5 to 3? Where are the centers placed? At what point does adding more centers produce diminishing returns?  
   3. What happens if we remove population weighting and treat all points equally? How does this affect service equity vs. efficiency?
